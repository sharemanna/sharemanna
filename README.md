## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Sharemanna.ai is about making it easier for more people â€” especially small teams, students, and builders outside traditional tech hubs â€” to become AI creators themselves. By focusing on tangible, often overlooked problems, we aim to apply AI to civic improvement, operational efficiency, and economic opportunity. The mission is to unlock a long tail of meaningful use cases â€” each small on its own, but collectively powerful, forming a compounding model of innovation that scales from the bottom up.
